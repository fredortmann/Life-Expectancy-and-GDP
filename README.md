# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
# The csv file contains the GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth from 2000-2015 inclusive from 6 countries.

# The purpose of this analysis was to identify a relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy.

# We find there is a positive correlation between these two variables, with the data having a left skew.

# In the Latin American countries, we see that a decline in GDP coincides with a drop in life expectancy, however in Germany, we see no such relationship, # their life life expectancy is unaffected by a fluctuating GDP. We also see this is the same for USA, although their drop in GDP in 2008 is not as
# substantial as Mexico and Chile
